Amina entered the Campus under the fake identity of a student and approached the target, Senpai, very soon. She took advantage of Senpai's perverted personality to obtain a lot of useless information. However, due to Ellen's carelessness, the Student Council discovered the existence of the ninja organization and investigated Amina in detail, discovering that Amina was an android. The Student council president deliberately made their position clear to Amina and after some negotiation a temporary agreement was reached. The Student Council had since lifted its surveillance of Amina and had even offered her assistance.",

After being invited to the Campus, she created a new technological system of combining mechanical and modern science, which she learnt at the Campus. Due to an inherited trait running in her family, she has a very sensitive body. Any body contact with another person, regardless of gender, arouses her sexual desire and makes her wet, prolonged contact even causes her to squirt. Therefore, before she entered the campus, she avoided physical contact with others carefully and suppressed her sexual desires. However, that suppression only made her even more sensitive. When Lucy and Katherine learned about her condition, they decided to create a special diet for her to improve her situation. Afterwards, her reactions to bodily contact began to improve, but it also caused her long repressed sexual desire to emerge.",

It turned out that the music she had written had been approved by the spirit of music, who had even given her the power of some of the notes. \nShe had since received great acclaim for her musical performances and was now able to contribute in her own way to the fight against the infected bodies.",

It is said that you can only meet her in the courtyard of the Campus at night.\n\nIn the ancient East, there is a saying: ”A year's plan starts with spring.” - It refers to the arrival of spring that makes plants sprout and grow. The thirteenth Academy City welcomes spring with blossoms, and the Campus is no exception. Under the hard work of the botany teacher Amora, not only has the garden flourished, but even the courtyard within the Campus has recently become lush and vibrant. It attracts many scholars to linger in the courtyard during breaks, some taking a short nap, while others sit under the trees reading. Yet, recently some students exaggeratedly pointed out that the plants in the courtyard have the effect of eliminating negative emotions and purifying physically and mentally, though Amora insists that all the plants she takes care of are just ordinary ones.\n\nOne day in the middle of the night, after the mission ended, you dragged your exhausted body back to the Campus to complete the mission report. As you were passing through the Campus courtyard on your way back to the dormitory, you saw a young girl in uniform sitting under a large tree full of pink blossoms, gazing at the crescent moon in the sky. You were attracted by her figure and walked slowly towards the tree. She gracefully floated down in front of you, touched your cheek, and the coldness from her fingertips made you want to warm up this pitiful beauty immediately. Forgetting all fatigue and holding hands with the beauty, she seemed to approve of your actions in silence. Both of you fell onto the grass covered in petals, embracing each other. The next day when you woke up, you were disheveled lying under the tree. The beauty had disappeared, but you distinctly remembered the warmth left on your body from the one night stand with her. That night, you came to the courtyard alone again, and the beauty did appear in front of you, yet her figure had become more mature...",

Since she always hides in the lab for R&D and rarely exposes to sunlight, her skin is very pale. She is no athlete with no strength. She is skilled at R&D, but lacking self-care ability. Casual in nature and in clothing, but surprisingly has a sweet tooth - a big fan of snacks and sweets. Often racking her brains to research and publish so she always gets hungry. Yet, she doesn't gain weight easily. She usually shows little emotion on her face, but when seeing a snack she wants to eat, she will show a very cute expression.\n\nThe reason for making the teleportation device is simply because it seemed interesting. the original world was invaded by the Vexis virus, yet she was still devoted to developing a teleportation device. She made the device at the last moment before the world was destroyed and escaped to your world. During the process of collecting information, she discovered that you have a characteristic of being attractive to the opposite sex, listing you as a target of observation. She wants to know what actions you will take after going to other worlds, so she entices you to become her special agent and go to other worlds to collect different snacks.",
